# üë¨ MLATE V3: Multi-Tissue Scaffold Prediction Platform

**MLATE V3** is a fully integrated, machine learning-powered platform for predicting, optimizing, and generating detailed fabrication procedures for 3D-(bio)printed scaffolds in tissue engineering. This app enables researchers to input a wide range of biomaterials, cell lines, and printing parameters, and receive optimized scaffold compositions along with step-by-step printing instructions generated via Google Gemini.

## üöÄ Features

- üî¨ Predict scaffold quality based on printability and cell response
- üß™ Optimize biomaterial concentrations, cell densities, and printing parameters using Optuna
- üß† Powered by two fine-tuned **CatBoostClassifier** models
- üìã Automatically generates fabrication protocols with Gemini API
- üîê Enforces safe defaults and intelligent UI input validation
- üß± Uses a real-world, curated dataset of **2847 samples** across **multiple tissues and cell lines**

## üìÇ Dataset

This project includes a publicly available dataset (`Dataset.xlsx`) containing:
- 123 biomaterials
- 175 cell lines
- 7 printing parameters
- Scaffold performance labels

The dataset is available in the [Files and Versions](https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/your-space-name/blob/main/Dataset.xlsx) tab of this Space.

You may also optionally add this to Hugging Face Datasets for broader access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input**: User selects biomaterials, cell line, and printing parameters with min/max/step values
2. **Optimization**: Optuna runs 50 trials to maximize predicted scaffold quality (WSSQ)
3. **Prediction**:
    - Two CatBoost models are used to predict:
        - `Printability` (3-class)
        - `Cell Response` (5-class)
    - Probabilistic predictions are mapped to expected scores
4. **Scaffold Quality**: A weighted combination of printability and cell response
5. **Procedure Generation**: A Gemini API prompt generates custom step-by-step fabrication instructions
